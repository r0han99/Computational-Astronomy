This is a brief overview of how Astronomers around the world _Analyse_, and _Process_ the astronomical data catalogues to gain scientific knowledge. 

Astronomy has quickly evolved from hand derived outlooks of classification into a sophisticated computational methods of classifying targets by just passing in the data. Over the decade the advancement in the computer science industry parallelly benefitted the astronomy field as well.

Concepts Covered in this repository
```
1. Basic Concept of how Pulsars are detected. And how Astronomical data is collected and Handled.
2. Exploratory data analysis on the Kepler-Exoplanet Archive.
3. Naive and Advanced techniques of Cross-Matching two Sky-survey Catalogues.
4. Galaxy classification using Sophisticated Machine Learning Algorithms and evaluating the results using Confusion Matrices.
```


_Note_, The concepts covered in this repo,  simulates the basic nature of how the workflow actually is when dealing with astronomy data catalogues . The complexity, in reality, is far greater than what we can comprehend, At least for me. Ultimately, the universe itself is infinite and we can never zero down absolute answers.



_This repo will be updated with all the new methodology I learn under DataScience and Deeplearning_
